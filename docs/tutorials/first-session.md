# Your First Session

This tutorial guides you through your first browsing session with Astronomo. By the end, you'll be comfortable navigating Geminispace from the terminal.

**Time:** 10 minutes

## Prerequisites

- Astronomo installed ([Installation Guide](../installation.md))
- A terminal emulator with good Unicode support

## Step 1: Launch Astronomo

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
astronomo
```

You'll see the Astronomo interface with:

- A header bar at the top
- Navigation buttons (◀ ▶) and an address bar
- A content area (empty on first launch)
- A footer showing available commands

## Step 2: Visit Your First Page

Let's visit the official Gemini Protocol homepage.

1. Click in the address bar (or it should already be focused)
2. Type: `geminiprotocol.net`
3. Press ++enter++

!!! tip
    You don't need to type `gemini://` - Astronomo adds it automatically.

The page loads and you'll see formatted Gemtext content with:

- Headings in different sizes
- Links highlighted and navigable
- Plain text paragraphs

## Step 3: Navigate Links

Simply click any link to follow it.

## Step 4: Go Back and Forward

After following a few links, use history navigation:

| Action | Keyboard | Mouse |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Go back | ++backspace++ | Click ◀ button |
| Go forward | ++shift+backspace++ | Click ▶ button |

Try navigating back through the pages you've visited.

## Step 5: Scroll the Page

For longer pages, scroll with:

- ++arrow-up++ / ++arrow-down++ - Scroll by line
- ++page-up++ / ++page-down++ - Scroll by page
- ++home++ / ++end++ - Jump to top/bottom
- Mouse scroll wheel

## Step 6: Add a Bookmark

Found a page you like? Save it:

1. Press ++ctrl+d++
2. A dialog appears with the page title
3. Edit the title if you want
4. Optionally select a folder
5. Press ++enter++ to save

## Step 7: View Your Bookmarks

Press ++ctrl+b++ to open the bookmarks sidebar:

- Press ++ctrl+b++ again to close the sidebar

## Step 8: Explore More

Here are some interesting Gemini capsules to visit:
